            Many studies have found that teaching Computer Science within a certain context can greatly improve studentsâ€™ learning experience. In particular, teaching Computer Science within the context of robotics has been shown to be beneficial in many cases.
            The often prohibitive cost of providing every student with their own personal robot has hindered the adoption of the robots as teaching aids in the Computer Science classroom. The RASPIED project tries to solve this by using a single robot that is shared by all students.

            Students simply need to book the times that they wish to use the robot and are then able to upload code to the robot and view a live video stream of its behaviour.
            The RASPIED project provides you, the student, with a robot that you can program using Python. You can now put into action all the exciting Computer Science concepts that you learned in class. All you have to do is book a session with the robot, upload your code to the robot, and then watch the live video stream of the robot as it runs <strong>your</strong> code!
